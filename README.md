# TradeManagementsystem
The Trade Management System (TMS), also called MoneyBuddy, is a user-friendly web application designed to simplify stock trading and portfolio management. Built using Angular for the frontend, Java Spring for the backend, and MariaDB for the database, it offers a well-rounded, reliable platform for users. This project was selected because of its practical significance and the opportunity it provides to apply database management principles to a real-world scenario. With the growing popularity of online trading, this application stands out by focusing on simplicity, accessibility, and security. It includes essential features like secure login and registration, a first-come-first-serve order processing system, tools to monitor and manage trade histories and portfolios, and instant email notifications for user transactions. Together, these features create a seamless trading experience while also giving users valuable insights to make informed decisions. This project represents a blend of technical skills and creative problem-solving to address modern challenges in the world of financial technology.


The database for the Trade Management System was thoughtfully designed to handle user data, stock transactions, and portfolio management efficiently. Using MariaDB as the platform, we started by creating an Entity-Relationship (E-R) model to map out the key entities and their relationships. Core entities include Client, Client_Instrument, Transactions, BuyStocks, and SellStocks, which together capture the flow of data in the trading process. For instance, the Client entity connects to Client_Instrument to track the stocks owned by each user, while Transactions detail the buying and selling activities between traders. These entities were translated into a relational schema, with tables like Client to store user information, Client_Instrument to track stocks, and Transactions to log trades. Each table was carefully normalized to either Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) or Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and preserve data integrity. Primary and foreign key constraints maintain relationships between tables, while additional constraints, such as unique and check constraints, ensure accurate and consistent data. This structured design enables the database to effectively support all application features, from secure user authentication to accurate portfolio ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9269502-e474-4652-af46-453bc931835c)
